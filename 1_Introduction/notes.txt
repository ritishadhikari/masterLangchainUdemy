Langchain is an open-source framework that equips developers 
with the necessary tools to create applications powered by
large language models (LLMs)

Why do we need Langchain?
    - Most of the LLMs are not up to date
    - They are not good at domain knowlegde and fail when
    working with Proprietary data
    - Working with different LLMs may become a tedious task

Langchain Benefits:
    - Data-Aware:
        - Langchain enables you to link your LLM to other data
        sources including file systems, databases, and APIs
        - As opposed to those that merely reach out to an LLM
        via an API, it is now possible to create apps that are
        more robust and creative
    - Agentic:
        - Langchain enables you to create agents that employ 
        LLMs to decide what to do and how to do it
        - As a result, it is now possible to create 
        applications that can communicate more effectively
        with the environment
    - Chains:
        - You can chain togather several calls to an LLM or
        other utilities using Langchain
        - This enables the development of more advanced 
        projects that are capable of handling many different
        tasks
