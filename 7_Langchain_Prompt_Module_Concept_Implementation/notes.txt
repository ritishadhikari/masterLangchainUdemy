Prompt Templates

Example Selectors:
    - They are tools that take user input and provide a list of relevant examples
    to enhance prompt construction
    - The FewShotPromptTemplate enables the inclusion of a few examples within 
    prompts, which the model can read and use to apply to user input, enhancing 
    the model's ability to handle specific tasks or scenarios.
    - Length based example selectors choses examples based on length, useful to 
    prevent prompt exceeding context window
    - It selects fewer examples for longer inputs and more for shorter ones, ensuring
    prompt fits within limits

Output Parsers:
    - In many of the scenarios, you may want to get more structured information
    than just text back
