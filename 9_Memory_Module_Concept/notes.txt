Conversational Chatbots are Stateless and don't carry memory by default.

Types of Memories Available in Langchain:
    - ConversationalBufferMemory
    - ConversationalBufferWindowMemory
    - EntityMemory
    - ConversationKnowledgeGraphMemory
    - ConversationSummaryMemory
    - ConversationSummaryBufferMemory
    - ConversationTokenBufferMemory:
        - Unlike other methods that rely on the number of interactions, this memory
        system determines when to clear or flush interactions based on the length of
        tokens used
        - Buffer is cleared when the token count exceeds a certain threshold
    - VectorStore-BackedMemory
